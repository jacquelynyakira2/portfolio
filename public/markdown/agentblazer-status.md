## The Challenge

With the launch of Agentforce, Salesforce entered a new era of AI-powered automation. We needed a way to recognize and celebrate the growing community of learners and builders working with this new technology. The traditional "Trailblazer" identity needed evolution to reflect the AI-first future.

## The Solution

We launched three new status tiers tied to learning AI and building with Agentforce. These statuses create a progression path that motivates learners while celebrating their achievements in the AI space.

### The Three Status Levels

#### 1. Agentblazer Explorer
**For those beginning their AI journey**
- Completed introductory AI and Agentforce modules
- Understanding fundamental AI concepts
- Exploring use cases for their organization

#### 2. Agentblazer Builder
**For those actively creating AI solutions**
- Built and deployed Agentforce solutions
- Demonstrated hands-on AI implementation skills
- Contributing to the Agentforce community

#### 3. Agentblazer Champion
**For AI leaders and innovators**
- Advanced Agentforce expertise
- Mentoring others in the community
- Driving AI adoption in their organizations
