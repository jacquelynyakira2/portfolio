## How Intent-Based Computing Kills the App

**Anu Jakobson** and **Emma Firth** are pioneering a new approach to digital interaction that moves beyond traditional app-based interfaces toward more intuitive, intent-driven experiences.

The traditional app model is breaking down. Users don't want to navigate through complex interfaces—they want to express their intent and have technology respond intelligently. This shift represents a fundamental change in how we think about digital product design.

> "I'm five and I want to be an artist," said the child, pointing to a blank canvas. The AI understood not just the words, but the creative intent behind them.

## Key Insights

- **Intent Recognition**: Moving from command-based to intent-based interactions
- **Contextual Awareness**: Systems that understand user goals, not just actions  
- **Seamless Integration**: Breaking down silos between different tools and platforms
- **Human-Centered AI**: Technology that amplifies human creativity rather than replacing it

## The Future of Digital Experience

As we move toward this new paradigm, designers must think differently about:

1. **Information Architecture**: How do we structure content for intent rather than navigation?
2. **Interaction Patterns**: What gestures and commands feel natural for expressing intent?
3. **Feedback Systems**: How do we show users that their intent has been understood?
4. **Error Handling**: What happens when the system misinterprets user intent?
