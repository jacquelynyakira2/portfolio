**About the Competition:**
"Far From Home" was selected as a finalist for the inaugural GEN:48 competition hosted by RunwayML in 2023, marking a milestone in generative AI filmmaking. GEN:48 is a global challenge where creatives are tasked to ideate, produce, and complete a 1–4 minute film in just 48 hours—leveraging AI tools to push the boundaries of visual storytelling.

RunwayML, a leader in creative AI, provided one of the first accessible platforms for artists to experiment with text-to-image and text-to-video models at scale. At the time, the technology had only recently become available for public use: model outputs were unpredictable, workflows were largely custom-built, and image-to-video generation faced significant technical limitations compared to the multi-modal and video-native models found in later GEN:48 editions.

For "Far From Home," we generated over 3,000 original images using Midjourney's early generative models, navigating the constraints of rendering speed, coherence, and resolution to produce a visually compelling narrative. The film's selection as a GEN:48 finalist recognized both creative execution and technical ingenuity in an environment where most processes required manual iteration, model fine-tuning, and adaptive storytelling.

Participating in GEN:48 not only showcased our ability to harness AI's emerging capabilities—it demonstrated the creative possibilities unlocked even by first-generation generative platforms, setting the stage for the evolution of AI-powered filmmaking.
