## Project Overview

**Role:** Principal Product Design Director  
**Timeline:** 2024 - Present  
**Platform:** Salesforce Trailhead  

---

## The Challenge

As Salesforce's learning platform grew to millions of users worldwide, we needed to create a more personalized, adaptive learning experience. Traditional learning paths couldn't account for each learner's unique background, pace, and goals.

---

## The Solution

I led the design for Trailhead's first agentic learning experience - an AI-powered agent that acts as a personal learning companion. This agent helps learners navigate content, answer questions in real-time, and provide personalized guidance throughout their Salesforce learning journey.

### Key Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction that feels like chatting with a knowledgeable mentor
- **Contextual Awareness**: The agent understands where learners are in their journey and provides relevant assistance
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests next steps based on learning history, goals, and skill gaps
- **Real-time Support**: Answers questions instantly without leaving the learning environment

---

## Design Process

### 1. Research & Discovery
- Conducted user interviews with Trailhead learners at various skill levels
- Analyzed common support questions and learning pain points
- Studied successful AI assistant patterns across education platforms

### 2. Defining the Agent's Personality
- Created a voice and tone that feels supportive, not intimidating
- Ensured the agent reflects Salesforce's Trailblazer culture
- Balanced helpfulness with encouraging independent problem-solving

### 3. Information Architecture
- Mapped out conversation flows for common learning scenarios
- Designed fallback patterns for unexpected queries
- Created handoff mechanisms for complex issues requiring human support

### 4. Visual Design
- Integrated the agent seamlessly into the existing Trailhead UI
- Designed an interface that feels native, not intrusive
- Created visual indicators for agent confidence levels and response types

### 5. Testing & Iteration
- Beta tested with diverse learner groups
- Refined responses based on user feedback
- Continuously improved accuracy and helpfulness

## Impact

- **Enhanced Learning Experience**: Learners report feeling more supported and confident
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Common questions are resolved instantly by the agent
- **Increased Engagement**: Users spend more time learning with agent assistance
- **Accessibility**: Makes learning more approachable for beginners

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Trust is earned gradually**: We learned that users need to see the agent succeed in small tasks before trusting it with bigger questions
2. **Context is everything**: The more the agent knows about a learner's journey, the more helpful it can be
3. **Transparency matters**: Being clear about what the agent can and cannot do builds confidence
