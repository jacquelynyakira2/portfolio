## Project Overview

**Role:** Principal Product Design Director  
**Timeline:** 2024 - 2025  
**Platform:** Salesforce Help Portal  

---

## The Challenge

Salesforce's support team handles millions of customer inquiries annually. Many questions are repetitive and could be resolved without human intervention, yet customers still had to wait for support engineers. We needed a solution that could provide instant, accurate answers while maintaining the quality of service Salesforce is known for.

---

## The Solution

As "customer zero" for Salesforce's Agentforce technology, I helped launch Salesforce's first Help Agent - an AI-powered support assistant that autonomously handles customer support cases. This agent has become a cornerstone of Salesforce's support strategy, fundamentally changing how customers get help.

---

## Key Features

### Intelligent Case Resolution
- **Autonomous Problem-Solving**: Handles routine inquiries without human intervention
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Can diagnose issues and provide step-by-step solutions
- **Knowledge Integration**: Accesses Salesforce's entire knowledge base in real-time

### Smart Escalation
- **Context Preservation**: When escalating to humans, provides full conversation history
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only escalates when uncertain about the solution
- **Seamless Handoff**: Transitions smoothly between agent and human support

### Continuous Learning
- **Feedback Loops**: Learns from successful and unsuccessful interactions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies emerging issues before they become widespread
- **Content Gaps**: Flags areas where documentation needs improvement

---

## Impact by the Numbers

### Resolution Metrics
- **1+ Million** support requests handled (as of mid-2025)
- **83-84%** autonomous resolution rate
- **2%** escalation rate to human agents
- **380,000+** customer interactions resolved in first 6 months

### Business Impact
- **$50 Million** estimated annual cost savings for 2025
- **Faster Response Times**: Instant answers vs. hours of wait time
- **Freed Up Resources**: Support engineers can focus on complex, high-value cases

## Design Process

### 1. Understanding the Problem
- Analyzed years of support ticket data to identify patterns
- Interviewed support engineers to understand common pain points
- Mapped customer support journeys from multiple perspectives

### 2. Defining Success Metrics
- Established clear KPIs for autonomous resolution
- Created quality benchmarks that matched human support standards
- Designed fallback mechanisms for edge cases

### 3. Crafting the Experience

#### Voice & Tone
- Professional yet approachable
- Clear and concise explanations
- Empathetic to customer frustration

#### Conversation Design
- Efficient information gathering without feeling interrogative
- Progressive disclosure of solutions
- Multiple pathways to reach the same answer

### 4. Building Trust
- Clear identification as an AI agent (transparency)
- Confidence indicators for each response
- Easy access to human support when needed

### 5. Testing & Refinement
- Pilot program with select customers
- A/B testing different conversation approaches
- Iterative improvements based on resolution rates

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Transparency Builds Trust
Being upfront about the AI nature of the agent actually increased user confidence. Customers appreciated knowing they were interacting with an AI and understood its capabilities and limitations.

### 2. Context is Critical
The agent performs significantly better when it has access to:
- Customer's Salesforce edition and configuration
- Recent account activity
- Previous support interactions
- Current system status

### 3. The 80/20 Rule Applies
We found that 20% of question types accounted for 80% of support volume. Focusing on perfecting responses to these common questions had the biggest impact.

### 4. Human Escalation is a Feature, Not a Failure
Knowing when to escalate to human support is as important as resolving cases autonomously. We designed the escalation process to feel natural and helpful, not like a failure.

## Technical Architecture

- **Agentforce Platform**: Built on Salesforce's native AI agent framework
- **Einstein AI**: Powers natural language understanding and generation
- **Data Cloud Integration**: Real-time access to customer and account data
- **Knowledge Graph**: Structured representation of Salesforce documentation

---

## Challenges Overcome

### Handling Edge Cases
Created a robust fallback system for unusual or complex scenarios that gracefully guides users to appropriate resources.

### Maintaining Accuracy
Implemented strict quality controls and regular audits to ensure the agent provides correct information, updating knowledge as Salesforce products evolve.

### Balancing Automation with Empathy
Designed conversation flows that acknowledge user frustration and provide emotional support, not just technical solutions.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Proactive Support**: Anticipating issues before customers encounter them
- **Multi-language Support**: Expanding to serve global customers in their native languages
- **Visual Guidance**: Adding screenshots and video explanations to text responses
- **Integration with Developer Console**: Helping developers debug code directly in the agent interface
