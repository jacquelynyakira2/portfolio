# Tiny UI: Reaction Bubbles

Design Study • UI Patterns • Micro-interactions • 2024

---

## Origins

The inspiration for this study came from observing how **iMessage replies** and **reaction bubbles** form peculiar shapes and organic, almost molecular patterns when clustered together. These small UI elements create visual relationships that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

> What started as a simple observation became a comprehensive catalog of similar instances across apps and products, revealing patterns in how we communicate through micro-interactions.

## The Patterns

### Clustered Reactions
When multiple reactions gather around a message, they create organic, almost molecular patterns that feel natural and intuitive.

### Contextual Grouping  
Small UI elements naturally group themselves based on context and user behavior, creating visual hierarchies without explicit design.

### Organic Shapes
The rounded, bubble-like nature of these elements creates soft, approachable interfaces that feel more human than rigid geometric designs.

## Implementation Examples

### Chat Reactions
- **"Oof"** with reply indicators
- **"HA HA"** laughter reactions  
- **"Order t"** with clustered emoji responses

### Design Principles
1. **Soft Geometry**: Rounded corners and organic shapes
2. **Contextual Clustering**: Elements group naturally based on meaning
3. **Subtle Animation**: Gentle transitions that feel alive
4. **Color Psychology**: Using color to reinforce emotional context
