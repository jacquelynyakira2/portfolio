## Principal Product Design Director at Salesforce

Thanks for stopping by! I am a creative technologist and product designer based in the U.S., specializing in AI-driven experiences, product design, and creative technology.

My work spans from building consumer AI features to designing accessible learning tools, generative art, and experimental storytelling. I believe technology isn’t just built for utility—it’s crafted through curiosity, iteration, and an unrelenting pursuit of meaningful human experiences.

**I believe AI is meant to elevate you, not replace you.**
