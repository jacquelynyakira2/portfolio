## Project Overview

**Role:** Principal Product Design Director  
**Timeline:** 2024 - Present  
**Platform:** Salesforce Trailhead  

---

## The Challenge

As Trailhead grew to include thousands of learning modules across Salesforce products, MuleSoft, Tableau, Slack, and more, users struggled to find relevant content. The existing navigation and filtering system wasn't designed for this scale, and learners often felt overwhelmed by choice.

**Key Problems:**
- Difficulty discovering relevant content
- No clear skill progression paths
- Industry-specific needs weren't addressed
- Product lines felt siloed from each other

---

## The Solution

I led a comprehensive redesign of Trailhead's content organization system, introducing a new taxonomy built around **Skills**, **Products**, and **Industries**. This three-dimensional approach helps learners navigate content from multiple perspectives based on their unique needs.

---

## The New Taxonomy

### 1. Skills
**What you want to learn**

Organized learning by competencies rather than products:
- **Technical Skills**: Development, Administration, Integration
- **Business Skills**: Sales, Marketing, Service
- **Soft Skills**: Leadership, Communication, Problem-solving
- **Emerging Skills**: AI/ML, Data Science, Automation

### 2. Products
**What tools you want to master**

Clear organization by product family:
- Salesforce Platform (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, etc.)
- MuleSoft (Integration & APIs)
- Tableau (Analytics & Visualization)
- Slack (Collaboration)
- Agentforce (AI Agents)

### 3. Industries
**Your business context**

Tailored learning paths for specific sectors:
- Financial Services
- Healthcare & Life Sciences
- Retail & Consumer Goods
- Manufacturing
- Public Sector
- And more...

## Design Process

### 1. Research & Discovery

#### User Research
- Conducted 50+ user interviews across different roles
- Analyzed search patterns and failed searches
- Studied content discovery behaviors
- Created user journey maps for different personas

#### Content Audit
- Catalogued all existing Trailhead content
- Identified gaps and redundancies
- Mapped relationships between modules
- Analyzed metadata quality and consistency

#### Competitive Analysis
- Studied learning platforms (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, Udemy)
- Analyzed e-commerce filtering systems
- Reviewed technical documentation sites

### 2. Information Architecture

#### Taxonomy Development
- Collaborated with subject matter experts
- Created hierarchical structure for each dimension
- Defined clear rules for content tagging
- Built relationships between taxonomy terms

#### Content Mapping
- Re-tagged thousands of learning modules
- Created skill progression paths
- Identified prerequisite relationships
- Built recommended learning sequences

### 3. User Interface Design

#### Content Overview Pages
Redesigned landing pages for skills, products, and industries to:
- Provide clear value propositions
- Show learning paths and progression
- Highlight popular and trending content
- Display relevant metrics (time, difficulty, prerequisites)

#### Filtering System
Created a multi-faceted filter interface that:
- Allows filtering by any combination of dimensions
- Shows result counts in real-time
- Persists filter state across sessions
- Provides smart defaults based on user profile

#### Search Enhancement
Improved search to understand:
- Skill-based queries ("How do I become an admin?")
- Product-specific searches ("Tableau for beginners")
- Industry contexts ("Financial services compliance")
- Role-based searches ("Content for developers")

- Next logical steps in learning journey
- Skills that complement what you've already learned
- Industry-specific content based on profile
- Trending topics in your area of interest

### Skill Progression Visualization
Clear visual indicators showing:
- Your current skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Progress toward next level
- Recommended path forward
- Related skills worth exploring

### Industry-Specific Views
Customized experiences for each industry:
- Role-specific learning paths
- Compliance and certification requirements
- Real-world use cases and examples
- Industry terminology and context

---

## Technical Implementation

### Tagging System
- Multi-dimensional tagging framework
- Automated tag suggestions using ML
- Quality control workflows for tag accuracy
- Bulk re-tagging tools for efficiency

### Search Infrastructure

- Semantic search to find conceptually related content
- Personalization based on user history
- A/B testing framework for search relevance

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient filtering with instant results
- Caching strategies for common queries
- Progressive loading for large result sets
- Mobile-optimized experiences

---

## Impact

### User Success Metrics
- **40% reduction** in time to find relevant content
- **35% increase** in course completion rates
- **50% more** cross-product learning
- **Higher satisfaction** scores for content discovery

### Business Impact
- Increased engagement across all product families
- Better distribution of learners across content catalog
- Reduced support inquiries about finding content
- Improved content ROI through better discoverability

### Content Team Benefits
- Clear guidelines for creating new content
- Consistent metadata standards
- Better understanding of content gaps
- Data-driven content strategy

---

## Design Highlights

### Visual System
- **Color Coding**: Each product family has a distinctive color
- **Icons**: Clear, recognizable icons for skills and industries
- **Typography**: Hierarchy that guides scanning and reading
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace reduces cognitive load

### Interaction Patterns
- **Filter Chips**: Visual, removable filters that show active selections
- **Hover States**: Preview content details without leaving the page
- **Breadcrumbs**: Always know where you are in the taxonomy
- **Saved Searches**: Bookmark common filter combinations

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first filtering interface
- Touch-optimized controls
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Consistent experience across devices

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Start with User Mental Models
The taxonomy needed to match how people think about learning, not how we organized content internally.

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Navigation is Powerful
Different users approach content discovery differently. Supporting multiple pathways increases success for everyone.

### 3. Tagging Quality is Critical
Even the best interface fails if content isn't tagged accurately and consistently.

### 4. Show Progress, Not Just Destinations
Learners are motivated by seeing how far they've come and what's next.

---

## Challenges Overcome

### Content Re-Tagging at Scale
Created semi-automated systems and clear workflows to re-tag thousands of modules without disrupting the live platform.

### Balancing Flexibility and Simplicity
The system needed to be powerful enough for advanced users while remaining approachable for beginners.

### Cross-Product Consistency
Ensuring the taxonomy made sense across very different products (Salesforce, Tableau, MuleSoft, Slack).

### Performance with Large Result Sets
Optimizing filter interactions to feel instant even when searching thousands of items.
