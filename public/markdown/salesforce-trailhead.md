### Salesforce Help Agent
I helped launch Salesforce's first Help agent as customer zero for Salesforce technology. Agentforce is now handling the majority of Salesforce’s customer support cases, autonomously resolving more than 80% of queries and crossing the one million support milestone in less than a year.  

- Agentforce has handled over 1 million support requests on Salesforce Help as of mid-2025, helping deliver faster answers, scale meaningful service, and free up support engineers for complex cases.
- In Salesforce’s own operations, Agentforce directly resolved over 380,000 customer support interactions in its first six months, with an autonomous resolution rate of 83-84% (only 2% needing human escalation).
- Agentforce’s deployment has resulted in an estimated $50 million in annual cost savings for Salesforce in 2025 due to its high case-resolution efficiency.

**Merging Communities**  
With [Slack](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/neighborhoods/slack), [Mulesoft](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/neighborhoods/mulesoft), and Tableau being a part of the ecosystem, we wanted a way to have a single space for community. This project involved migrating these communities into the Trailblazer community. I helped create a scalable framework (neighborhood lite pages) to make the transition user friendly.
