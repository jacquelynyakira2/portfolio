## About Trailhead

[Salesforce Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/) is the world's most popular learning platform for Salesforce skills. It provides interactive, hands-on learning experiences through guided projects, badges, and trails that help learners build expertise in CRM, cloud computing, and business applications.

## Key Features I've Helped Launch

### Recent Launches
- **Trailhead Learning Agent**: Currently leading design for our agentic experience for Salesforce learning. 
- **Salesforce Help Agent**: I helped launch Salesforce's first Help agent as customer zero for Salesforce technology. 
- **Agentblazer Status**: With the launch of Agentforce and the rapidly changing landscape we launched three new Statuses tied to learning AI and skilling up with Agentforce.
- **Skill Taxonomy**: Redesigning content filtering, content overview pages and more to showcase the new taxonomy for skills, products and industries. 
- **Merging Communities**: With [Slack](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/neighborhoods/slack), [Mulesoft](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/neighborhoods/mulesoft), and Tableau being a part of the ecosystem, we wanted a way to have a single space for community. This project involved migrating these communities into the Trailblazer community. I helped create a scalable framework (neighborhood lite pages) to make the transition user friendly.
