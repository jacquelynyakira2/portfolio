## Project Overview

**Role:** Principal Product Design Director  
**Timeline:** 2023 - 2024  
**Platform:** Trailblazer Community  

---

## The Challenge

Salesforce's acquisitions of Slack, MuleSoft, and Tableau brought incredible new capabilities to the ecosystem, but also created fragmented communities. Each had its own:
- Community platforms and forums
- Cultural identity (Slack Stars, Muleys, DataFam)
- Content and resources
- Events and meetups

Users working across multiple products had to navigate separate community spaces, creating friction and missed opportunities for cross-pollination.

---

## The Solution

I helped design and implement a unified community experience using a "Neighborhood" framework. This approach brought all communities under one roof while preserving the unique identities and cultures that made each special.

---

## The Neighborhood Framework

### What is a Neighborhood?

Think of the Trailblazer Community as a city, and Neighborhoods as distinct districts within it. Each Neighborhood:
- Has its own identity and culture
- Provides specialized resources and content
- Maintains familiar touchpoints for existing community members
- Connects seamlessly to the larger community

### The Neighborhoods

#### Slack Neighborhood
**For the Slack Stars community**
- Collaboration tips and best practices
- App integration guides
- Workflow automation resources
- Platform updates and announcements

#### MuleSoft Neighborhood
**For the Muleys community**
- API design patterns
- Integration best practices
- Developer resources
- Technical forums

#### Tableau Neighborhood
**For the DataFam community**
- Data visualization techniques
- Dashboard design inspiration
- Analytics best practices
- User group information

## Design Process

### 1. Discovery & Empathy

#### Community Listening Tour
- Met with active members from each community
- Attended community events (TableauConf, Slack meetups, etc.)
- Analyzed discussion topics and engagement patterns
- Understood what made each community special

#### Stakeholder Interviews
- Community managers from each product
- Product leaders
- Marketing and events teams
- Power users and advocates

#### Risk Assessment
- Identified fears about losing community identity
- Understood technical migration challenges
- Planned for potential engagement drops during transition

### 2. Strategy & Framework Development

#### Core Principles
1. **Preserve Identity**: Don't erase what makes each community unique
2. **Enable Connection**: Make it easy to discover related communities
3. **Reduce Friction**: Single login, unified experience
4. **Scale Efficiently**: Create a framework that works for future products too

#### Neighborhood Lite Pages
Created a scalable template system that:
- Provides consistent structure across all neighborhoods
- Allows customization for each community's needs
- Reduces development time for new neighborhoods
- Maintains brand coherence

### 3. Experience Design

#### Visual Identity
- Each neighborhood has distinctive colors and graphics
- Consistent layout creates familiarity across neighborhoods
- Hero imagery reflects each community's culture
- Icons and badges maintain product brand recognition

#### Navigation
- Clear entry points from main community homepage
- Breadcrumbs show neighborhood context
- Easy switching between neighborhoods
- "You might also like" cross-promotion

#### Content Organization
- Product-specific discussion forums
- Learning resources tailored to each product
- Events calendar filtered by neighborhood
- Success stories and use cases

## Key Learnings

### 1. Community Identity is Sacred
People deeply value their community's unique culture. We had to be extremely thoughtful about preserving what made each special.

### 2. Change Requires Clear Communication
We over-communicated throughout the process - previews, beta programs, FAQs, office hours, and launch communications.

### 3. Templates Enable Scale
The Neighborhood Lite framework means we can onboard new communities much faster now, with consistent quality.

### 4. Migration is a Marathon
We rolled out in phases, learning from each and adjusting. Trying to do everything at once would have been disastrous.

## Challenges Overcome

### Cultural Integration
**Challenge**: Fear that unique community cultures would be diluted  
**Solution**: Strong visual and content differentiation for each neighborhood, plus community-specific features

### Technical Complexity
**Challenge**: Migrating multiple platforms with different data structures  
**Solution**: Built robust migration tools and extensively tested before launch

### Change Management
**Challenge**: Resistance from users comfortable with existing platforms  
**Solution**: Beta program with power users, extensive support resources, and gradual rollout

### Search Relevance
**Challenge**: Unified search needed to understand product-specific terminology  
**Solution**: Product-aware search algorithms and manual curation of difficult queries
